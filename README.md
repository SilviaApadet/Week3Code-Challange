Week 3 Code Challenge: 

Flatdingo Movie Ticket Booking Application.

This project is a simple web application that allows users to view movies and purchase tickets.

 It fetches movie details from a REST API and allows users;

 ~ to select a movie

 ~view its details 

 ~ buy tickets

  If a movie is sold out, the interface reflects that by changing the button text to "Sold Out" and applying a sold-out class to the corresponding movie item.
